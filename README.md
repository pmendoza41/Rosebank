### Hello! 

My neighborhood is _Rosebank_ in Staten Island. [Here](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/map.geojson) is an outline of Rosebank on a geojson map. 

According to the on the [Census Tract Finder](https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx) on the FFIEC site, Rosebank has 647 families, 777 households, and 2,510 residents as of 2016. More than half of the population are minorities (50.20%). Other demographics are included in this document of [Rosebank](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/Rosebank.pdf). 

Just like any other neighborhood, residents in Rosebank occasionally get parking tickets. In Fiscal Year 2016, there were over _35,000_ tickets given to residents in the 120th Precinct, which oversees my neighborhood. Using filtered data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data), I was able to determine the top ten license plates that received the most parking tickets in FY 2016 which can be seen in this [python code](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/top%20ten%20parking%20tickets%20precinct%20120.py).  Based on the data, the **top ten licenses** that received the most parking tickets are listed below:

  1. plate CZP3172 has 89 tickets

  2. plate 93504MB has 81 tickets

  3. plate 91139MC has 73 tickets

  4. plate 93418MB has 60 tickets

  5. plate 93477MB has 56 tickets

  6. plate 525888N has 40 tickets

  7. plate HAE8702 has 40 tickets

  8. plate 568868N has 35 tickets

  9. plate EXM3967 has 33 tickets

  10. plate J255248 has 31 tickets.

I also determined the **top ten 311 complaints** made by Rosebank residents, which was found using [filtered data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data) and this [code](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/biggest%20311%20complaints.py). According to the data, residents made
* 6896 complaints for Street Condition
* 3598 complaints for Sewer
* 3506 complaints for Street Light Condition
* 3435 complaints for Water System
* 3251 complaints for Illegal Parking
* 2643 complaints for Missed Collection (All Materials) 
* 2230 complaints for Noise - Residential
* 1792 complaints for Blocked Driveway
* 1648 complaints for Sanitation Condition _AND_
* 1564 complaints for Damaged Tree

As a fellow resident, I understand why street condition is the top complaint. There are _many_ potholes that need to be fixed in Rosebank (even in Staten Island in general). An image of the 311 complaints made by residents in Rosebank can be seen [here](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/311%20complaints%20clustered.png).
