### Hello! 

![](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/Rosebank.jpg)

My neighborhood is _Rosebank_ in Staten Island. [Here](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/map.geojson) is an outline of Rosebank on a geojson map. 

 #### Demographics
 
According to the on the [Census Tract Finder](https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx) on the FFIEC site, Rosebank has 647 families, 777 households, and 2,510 residents as of 2016. More than half of the population are minorities (50.20%). Other demographics are included in this document of [Rosebank](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/Rosebank.pdf). 

#### Parking Tickets

Just like any other neighborhood, residents in Rosebank occasionally get parking tickets. In Fiscal Year 2016, there were over _35,000_ tickets given to residents in the 120th Precinct, which oversees my neighborhood. Using filtered data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus/data), I was able to determine the top ten license plates that received the most parking tickets in FY 2016. Based on the data, the [**top ten licenses**](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/top%20ten%20parking%20tickets%20precinct%20120.py) that received the most parking tickets are listed below:

| License Plate | Number of Parking Tickets |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| CZP3172 |  89 |
| 93504MB | 81 |
| 91139MC | 73 | 
| 93418MB | 60 |

| HAE8702 | 40 | 
| 568868N | 35 | 
| EXM3967 | 33 |

#### 311 Complaints

I also determined the **[top ten 311 complaints](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/biggest%20311%20complaints.py)**  made by Rosebank residents, which was found using [filtered data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data). The top ten 311 complaints in Rosebank are shown below.

| Street Light Condition | 3506 |

| Noise - Residential | 2230 | 
| Blocked Driveway | 1792 |

As a fellow resident, I understand why street condition is the top complaint. There are _many_ potholes that need to be fixed in Rosebank (even in Staten Island in general). An image of the 311 complaints made by residents in Rosebank can be seen in the picture below. ![](https://github.com/pmendoza41/Rosebank/blob/master/311%20complaints%20clustered.png)
